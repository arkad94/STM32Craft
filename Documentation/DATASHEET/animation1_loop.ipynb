    "## Introduction\n",
    "WS2812B LEDs are addressable RGB LEDs widely used for creating colorful and dynamic lighting effects. This document focuses on the implementation of a control loop that:\n",
    "- Cycles through all 16 LEDs in a strip.\n",
    "- Alternates between shades of red, the current color, and shades of green.\n",
    "- Adjusts the delay between cycles for a dynamic animation effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup and Configuration\n",
    "### MCU Initialization\n",
    "The `HAL_Init()` function initializes the Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) to prepare the STM32 microcontroller for operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Peripherals Configuration\n",
    "1. **System Clock**: Configured using `SystemClock_Config()` for consistent timing.\n",
    "2. **GPIO and DMA**: Required for WS2812B control using PWM signals.\n",
    "3. **Timer Initialization**: Timer 3 is configured for PWM generation on a specific pin (e.g., PB5).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## LED Control Loop\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "The control loop implements:\n",
    "1. **Alternating Colors**: Shades of red, current color, and green in sequence.\n",
    "2. **Dynamic Delays**: Gradual reduction in delay between cycles (1s, 0.5s, 0.25s).\n",
    "3. **Full Reset**: Clearing all LEDs after each complete cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Color Definitions\n",
    "Three distinct colors are defined in GRB format:\n",
    "- `redShade`: A predefined shade of red.\n",
    "- `currentColor`: The LEDâ€™s current color.\n",
    "- `greenShade`: A predefined shade of green.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```c\n",
    "uint8_t redShade[3] = {0x40, 0x00, 0x00};   // Shade of red\n",
    "uint8_t currentColor[3] = {0x6B, 0x00, 0x3C}; // Current color\n",
    "uint8_t greenShade[3] = {0x00, 0x40, 0x00}; // Shade of green\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cycling Logic\n",
    "The LEDs alternate colors based on their index position:\n",
    "- LEDs with indices divisible by 3 are set to `redShade`.\n",
    "- Indices with a remainder of 1 are set to `currentColor`.\n",
    "- Indices with a remainder of 2 are set to `greenShade`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The logic is implemented as:\n",
    "```c\n",
    "if (i % 3 == 0)\n",
    "    WS2812_SetColor(i, redShade[0], redShade[1], redShade[2]);\n",
    "else if (i % 3 == 1)\n",
    "    WS2812_SetColor(i, currentColor[0], currentColor[1], currentColor[2]);\n",
    "else\n",
    "    WS2812_SetColor(i, greenShade[0], greenShade[1], greenShade[2]);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Delay Adjustments\n",
    "The delay between cycles decreases with each iteration:\n",
    "1. Starts at 1 second.\n",
    "2. Reduces to 0.5 seconds.\n",
    "3. Further reduces to 0.25 seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is controlled using:\n",
    "```c\n",
    "for (float delay = 1.0; delay >= 0.25; delay /= 2)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    HAL_Delay((int)(delay * 1000)); // Delay in milliseconds\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Code Walkthrough\n",
    "### Key Functions\n",
    "1. **`WS2812_SetColor`**:\n",
    "   Assigns color values to a specific LED in the buffer.\n",
    "2. **`WS2812_Refresh`**:\n",
    "   Converts buffer data into PWM signals and triggers DMA transfer to the LED strip.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Infinite Loop Explanation\n",
    "The `while(1)` loop performs the following steps:\n",
    "1. Loops through the delays: 1s, 0.5s, and 0.25s.\n",
    "2. Cycles through all 16 LEDs:\n",
    "   - Assigns colors based on index.\n",
    "   - Refreshes the LED strip.\n",
    "   - Delays based on the current delay value.\n",
    "3. Clears all LEDs after each cycle and adds a gap before the next cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```c\n",
    "for (int i = 0; i < NUM_LEDS; i++) {\n",
    "    // Alternate colors\n",
    "    if (i % 3 == 0)\n",
    "        WS2812_SetColor(i, redShade[0], redShade[1], redShade[2]);\n",
    "    else if (i % 3 == 1)\n",
    "        WS2812_SetColor(i, currentColor[0], currentColor[1], currentColor[2]);\n",
    "    else\n",
    "        WS2812_SetColor(i, greenShade[0], greenShade[1], greenShade[2]);\n",
    "\n",
    "    WS2812_Refresh();\n",
    "    HAL_Delay((int)(delay * 1000));\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "The WS2812B control loop leverages PWM and DMA for efficient LED control, alternating colors and delays to create dynamic lighting effects. This design ensures scalability and provides a template for more complex animations. By understanding each section of the loop, developers can adapt it for custom applications, enhancing creativity and functionality.\n",
