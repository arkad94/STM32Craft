    "## Key Considerations for Clock Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Application Type:**\n",
    "   - Use **HSE + PLLCLK** for high-frequency, performance-critical applications.\n",
    "   - Use **HSI** or **CSI** for low-cost or low-power systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Peripheral Requirements:**\n",
    "   - Some peripherals (e.g., USB, Ethernet) require specific clock frequencies (e.g., 48 MHz). Use **HSE + PLLCLK** to achieve these.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Power Consumption:**\n",
    "   - **HSI** and **CSI** consume less power than **HSE**.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Startup Time:**\n",
    "   - **HSI** offers the fastest startup time, suitable for time-critical boot sequences.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Practical Steps in STM32CubeIDE\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open the **Clock Configuration** tab in STM32CubeIDE.\n",
    "2. Select the desired **PLL Source** (HSI, CSI, HSE).\n",
    "3. Choose the **System Clock** from the MUX dropdown.\n",
    "4. Configure the PLL multipliers/dividers to achieve the desired system frequency.\n",
    "5. Verify that peripheral clock frequencies (e.g., USB, ADC) meet their requirements.\n",
