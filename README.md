## Overview

This repository serves as my learning ground for mastering STM32H7 microcontroller programming. The projects are structured to progressively introduce key concepts, starting with basic GPIO control and advancing to more complex peripherals like timers and DMA.

## Projects

### Project 1: Onboard LED Control

**Objective:**  
Control the onboard LEDs with animations and turn them off with a button press.

**Key Learnings:**  
- Configured GPIO pins to control the onboard LEDs.
- Learned how to create LED animations by adjusting timing.
- Configured GPIO to detect button presses and toggle LED states.

### Project 2: WS2812B LED Control

**Objective:**  
Drive a WS2812B LED to light up the first LED in blue using PWM and DMA.

**Key Learnings:**  
- Configured Timer 3, Channel 2 to generate PWM signals as per the WS2812B datasheet requirements.
- Utilized DMA (Memory-to-Peripheral) for efficient data transfer.
- Verified the timing to ensure compatibility with WS2812B protocol.

**Behavior:**  
- Upon flashing, the first LED lights up at best equivalent of **#FFAA1D**.
- If the LED does not turn on, press the reset button on the board.

**Gamma Correction**

Gamma correction is a technique used to improve the color accuracy of LEDs by adjusting their brightness levels to match the way human eyes perceive light. Hex codes represent RGB values linearly, but human vision perceives light logarithmically. Without gamma correction, the perceived brightness of LEDs can appear inaccurate, especially for mid-range and dimmer colors. In this project, gamma correction is applied to the RGB values of the WS2812B LEDs before sending them to the LED strip. The formula used for gamma correction is:

`Corrected Value = (Original Value / 255) ^ gamma * 255`

where `gamma` is set to 2.2, a standard value for most displays and LEDs.

By implementing gamma correction, the displayed colors appear closer to the intended ones, especially for dimmer shades. This update was added on December 12th, to enhance the visual output and improve the realism of the colors displayed by the WS2812B LED strip.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/arkad94/STM32Craft
   cd STM32Craft
   ```

2. **Prerequisites:**  
   - STM32CubeIDE installed
   - STM32H754ZI Nucleo board
   - WS2812B LEDs (for Project 2)

3. **Flashing Instructions:**  
   - Open the respective project folder in STM32CubeIDE.
   - Build and flash the project onto your STM32H7 Nucleo board.
   - For Project 2, ensure the LEDs are properly connected to the board.

## Notes and Tips

- **Project 2 Troubleshooting:** If the WS2812B LED does not turn on after flashing, press the **Reset** button on the STM32H754ZI board.
- This repository is a work in progress. Stay tuned for more projects as I delve deeper into STM32 programming!
